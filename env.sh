# This file was written in shell scripting because we do not have python at 
# this point.
# After the first check that python is there, we jump to a python environment 
# to ensure we support as many platforms as we can. If another platform 
# besides *nix is required, a different "shell env script" should be created. 
# i.e. for windows a env.bat should be created.

# Please try not to much too much logic here, we should maintain this file 
# as simple as possible

# Install section: this section install all the pre-requisites of the 
# environment. If other installers are supported they should maintain the
# function interface
