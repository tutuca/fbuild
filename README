Run source env.sh

To build everything:
scons

To clean everything:
scons -c

To create a doxygen component
env.Doxygen("Doxyfile")

To integrate a make project into scons, here is what to put in the SConscript file:
# Define the sources for the make build, so SCons can track dependencies
# (or just set source=None to have SCons run make all the time and
# let make track dependencies).
src = Glob('foo-1.2.3/*.c')

# Run make inside the foo-1.2.3/ directory
foolib = env.Make(source = src,
                  target = [ 'foo-1.2.3/.libs/libfoo.a',
                             'foo-1.2.3/.libs/libfoo.so' ],
                  MakePath = Dir('foo-1.2.3'))
