Run source env.sh

To build everything:
scons build_all
Note: build_all will also install because the target is usually the installation.

To run all unit tests:
scons run_all

To install everything:
scons install
Note: the difference between building all and installing is that some libraries build and then copy artifacts to the INSTALL_DIR. Examples of these artifacts are headers, static libraries and dinamic libraries.
Install alone is usefull when we want to copy all the artifacts to somewhere else.

To clean everything:
scons -c

To build, install and run everything:
scons
